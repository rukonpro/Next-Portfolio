            <p className="text-xl">API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface. It is a means of exchanging data. When we use
                an application on a mobile phone or computer, the application is connected to the Internet, and data is
                sent or a request is sent to a server. And the way that work is done is API.</p>

            <br/>
            <p className="text-xl">The purpose of the API is to transfer data from the client site to the server-side, and this is done via

            <h1 className="text-2xl">How an API works?</h1>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p className="text-xl">API work by sharing data and information between applications, systems, and devices making it possible to
                communicate with each other. Sometimes the easiest way to think about APIs is to think of a metaphor,
                and a common scenario that many people use is the customer, a waiter, and the kitchen of a restaurant: a
                customer talks to the waiter and tells the waiter what he wants. </p>

                />
            </div>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p className="text-xl">The waiter dropped the order and contacted the kitchen. The kitchen does their work, prepares the food
                and then the waiter returns the order to the customer. In this metaphor, a customer is like a user who
                tells the waiter what he wants. </p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p className="text-xl">{`The waiter, like an API, accepts the customer's order and translates the order into easy-to-follow
                instructions that the kitchen uses to fulfill that order often following a specific code or input that
                the kitchen can easily recognize. The kitchen is like a server that works to create order in the way the
                customer wants it, hopefully! When the meal is ready, the waiter picks up the order and undefined
                Delivers to the customer. undefined`}</p>
